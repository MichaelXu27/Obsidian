## What is the best programming language
* Java:
	* automatic garbage collection
* Typescript and Javascript knows how to be shipped with a browser
* C family:
	* it is everywhere
	* a lot of software is written with this language
	* libraries, debugging is all great
	* video game programming
	* speed, very fast
	* portable assembly language, nothing is slowing it down
* Go
	* Being pushed by google, allow people to write better parallel web code
* Python
	* huge libraries as well
	* dynamically typed
* SML: standard ML

Languages chosen:
![[Pasted image 20250826133745.png]]
* Functional programming language: do things recursively, everything is don't through functions
* Static vs Dynamic typed:
	* You have to explicitly give a type when declaring a variable in static
	* if you divide string by int in statically typed it will throw an error
	* python for instance will just run it and see how it goes
	* dynamically typed languages better for prototyping
* Java is pass by value but basically its pass by reference because they made everything a pointer
* Sub classes vs Super classes
	* subclass have more than a super class
	* superclass provide less subclasses have more to do
	* subclass has fewer objects that can be assigned to that super class

		Object o = name;
		
		Primate george = new Primate("george")
		
		String c = o;  //throws an error in java but is fine in python(we will see what happens)
				
		String c = (String)o;  //This works
